==N-GenIC==

This is N-GenIC-spb, an extended and optimised version of Volker Springel's 
N-GenIC program for generating Gadget-compatible initial conditions. 
Requires:
 - FFTW 3 (install the threaded, double-precision, version using your package manager).

Changes over the version of N-GenIC available from the Gadget website are:
- Ability to output Gadget files in HDF5, BigFile or gadget format 2. 
- Always uses the correct (different) transfer functions for DM and baryons. 
- Substantially lower memory usage for multiple species initial conditions.
- 2LPT term, using substantially less memory than the N-GenICs version by Scoccimarro et al.
- Parallelised with OpenMP rather than MPI.
- FFTW3
- Solves the growth equations exactly rather than using an approximation.
- Support for both fake (fourier-space) and particle neutrinos
- Written in C++11
- Many and various cleanups

To build the code, first you need to correctly check out GadgetReader with:

git submodule update --init --recursive

then do:

make

For the doxygen-generated documentation:

make doc

You can run tests with:
make test
provided you have boost::test installed.

To delete compiler output:

make clean or make cleanall

Further documentation may be found in the doxygen generated files in doc/html/index.html
(type "make doc" to make this file).
