==N-GenIC==

This is N-GenIC-spb, an extended and optimised version of Volker Springel's 
N-GenIC program for generating Gadget-compatible initial conditions. 
Requires the GadgetReader library and FFTW 3.

Changes over the version of N-GenIC available from the Gadget website are:
- Ability to output Format 2 Gadget files. 
- Always uses the correct (different) transfer functions for DM and baryons. 
- Substantially lower memory usage for multiple species initial conditions.
- 2LPT term, using substantially less memory than the N-GenICs version by Scoccimarro et al.
- Parallelised with OpenMP rather than MPI. 
- FFTW3
- Support for both fake (fourier-space) and particle neutrinos
- Many and various cleanups
- perl script that runs CAMB and N-GenIC in turn, consistently, and 
then generates a power spectrum with GenPK to compare with the input.

To build the library, do:

make
